%  The package is a toolbox of programming facilities geared primarily towards LaTeX class and package authors. It provides LaTeX frontends to some of the new primitives provided by e-TeX as well as some generic tools which are not strictly related to e-TeX but match the profile of this package. Note that the initial versions of this package were released under the name elatex.
% The package provides functions that seem to offer alternative ways of implementing some LaTeX kernel commands; nevertheless, the package will not modify any part of the LaTeX kernel. 
\RequirePackage{etoolbox}

% The package defines commands that switch according to the prevailing 'draft' or 'final' options; each command takes two arguments, the first for the 'true', the second for the 'false' case. Commands are:
%   \ifdraft determines whether we're operating in draft ('true') or final mode;
%   \ifoptiondraft determines whether a 'draft' option has been given; and
%   \ifoptionfinal determines whether a 'final' option has been given.
\RequirePackage{ifdraft}

% This package offers support for package authors who want to use options in key-value format for their package options.
% The package is part of the oberdiek bundle.
\RequirePackage{kvoptions}
