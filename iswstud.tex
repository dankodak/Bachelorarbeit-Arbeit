  In dieser Bachelorarbeit erweitern wir die Kernkollokation, ein Verfahren zur numerischen Lösung von partiellen Differentialgleichungen (\acs{PDE}s).\glsunset{PDE} Dafür nutzt die Kernkollokation einen interpolativen Ansatz, indem sie Ansatzfunktionen an verschiedenen Punkten im Inneren und auf dem Rand des Definitionsgebietes der \ac{PDE} ansetzt. Wir möchten den durch diese zwei Punktmengen entstehenden Aufwand verringern, indem wir nur die Punkte im Inneren betrachten. Dafür multiplizieren wir die Ansatzfunktionen mit einer Gewichtsfunktion und erreichen damit, dass die Randbedinungen der \ac{PDE} automatisch erfüllt werden und können somit die Ansatzpunkte auf dem Rand weglassen. Zusätzlich erhalten wir dadurch eine weitaus höhere Genauigkeit auf dem Rand. Experimentell zeigt sich, dass die gewichtete Kernkollokation aber nur bedingt vernünftige Ergebnisse liefert, da es bei der Konstruktion der Gewichtsfunktionen für ein beliebiges Gebiet leicht passieren kann, dass in deren Ableitung Singularitäten entstehen, die zu schlechten Ergebnissen führen.

    In this bachelor's thesis, we extend the kernel collocation, a method to solve partial differential equations (\acs{PDE}s)\glsunset{PDE} numerically. The kernel collocation uses an interpolating approach by applying functions at different points on the boundary and the interior of the domain of a \ac{PDE}. We want to reduce the effort by only looking at the interior points. To achieve this goal, we multiply the interpolating functions with a weight function to automatically fulfill the boundary conditions given by the \ac{PDE}. Thus, we don't need any points on the boundary. Additionally, we get a much higher accuracy on the boundary. Experiments show that we only get reasonable results in some cases when using the weighted kernel collocation. When constructing the weight function for an arbitrary domain, it can easily happen that we get singularities in their derivatives, which causes bad results.
